# ZFIND_USEREXITS_PLUS
Program to find User-exits, BADIs, BTEs, Etc by TCode or Program

First things first: This program was originally written by Pete Atkin, and submitted to SCN on 16 January 2010.
The original code can be found <a href="https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/Snippets/Find+User-exits%2C+BADIs%2C+BTEs%2C+Etc+by+TCode+or+Program">here</a>.

Unfortunately, I can not add comments there, nor can I contact Peter personally... But credits go to him for making this program.

What I did, is (hopefully) improve it a bit here and there. Next to cosmetic changes (on the selection screen) and some nerdy spelling corrections, I also changed the Text search. This was probably still under development because there were some issues with displaying the correct origins/sources where the string was found. It may be better now, but might still need improvement.

Anyway, I packed it into a SAPLINK nugget file and uploaded it here for future reference.

@Pete Atkins: 
I hope you don't mind and if you do... Let me know.
I'll take this offline ASAP, if you do not agree.
